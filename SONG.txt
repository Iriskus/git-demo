DUET
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field
I live in Nashville

form your line
shield by shield
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
